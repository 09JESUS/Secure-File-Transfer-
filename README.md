ðŸ”’ Secure File Transfer System
ðŸš€ Excited to Share My Latest Project: Secure File Transfer System

Iâ€™ve recently completed a Secure File Transfer System designed to provide a robust, secure, and user-friendly solution for uploading, storing, and sharing files safely. Leveraging modern browser storage technologies, encryption techniques, and real-time feedback, this system ensures complete control over file access and expiration settings.

ðŸš€ Project Overview
The Secure File Transfer System focuses on delivering a reliable platform where users can securely upload and download files, with enhanced protection mechanisms like password validation and expiration control. Utilizing IndexedDB for browser-based storage, coupled with real-time upload/download progress tracking and intuitive UI/UX, this project highlights key cybersecurity principles and modern web development practices.

This project has allowed me to sharpen my skills in encryption, secure storage management, UI optimization, and file handling, making it a perfect addition to my cybersecurity-focused portfolio.

ðŸ”‘ Key Features
Secure File Storage with Metadata Tracking:
Files are stored safely along with associated metadata such as:

Expiration dates.

Password protection settings.

Access control (who can download).

Improved Upload/Download Flow:
Real-time progress indicators ensure smooth uploads and downloads, providing feedback to users and validating passwords before access.

Enhanced UI/UX:
A fully responsive, modern interface designed for optimal user experience across all devices. Clean layouts, smooth interactions, and error-free navigation.

Advanced Security Features:

File Expiration Dates: Automatically deletes files after a user-defined period.

Password Protection: Files are encrypted and require a password to access.

Download Tracking: Monitors and logs who has accessed/downloaded each file.

Client-Side Encryption (AES-256): Ensures files are unreadable without proper credentials, adding an extra layer of security.

Browser Storage:
Uses IndexedDB for efficient, secure client-side file storage, ensuring high performance and security within the browser environment.

Toast Notifications:
Real-time notifications provide immediate user feedback for uploads, downloads, errors, and successful actions.

Frontend:

HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Responsive design principles for mobile and desktop compatibility.

Backend:

Flask (Python) for secure file handling and backend logic.

Storage & Encryption:

IndexedDB: For secure, local storage within the browser.

AES-256 Encryption: Ensures end-to-end security of files.

User Experience:

Real-time progress tracking.

Toast notifications for smooth interactions.

ðŸŽ¯ Objective
The goal of this project is to offer a practical, secure file transfer solution that aligns with modern cybersecurity standards. It demonstrates expertise in:

Secure storage and file handling.

Encryption methodologies.

Real-time feedback systems.

User authentication and access control.
